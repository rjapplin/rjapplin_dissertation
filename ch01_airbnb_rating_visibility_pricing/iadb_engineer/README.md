## Overview of Codebase to Engineer Inside Airbnb Database

The University of Kentucky Department of Economics purchased archived data from Inside Airbnb. The data came in a set of over 8000 raw CSV files for each location-time period. To manage this data, I engineered a SQL database out of these CSV files. This directory contains the codebase I developed to do this engineering as well as a file that downloads new data from the Inside Airbnb website and updates the database with new data.

Please note this directory does not contain any raw data. To run this code end to end, the code would expect a subdirectory, raw with subdirectories for each location. For example, raw/Asheville. Each of which would contain a CSV with data for that location for each time period. 

Please note that since graduating, I no longer maintain or update this database.
