This directory contains the code necessary to produce the results that appear in *Applin (2025).* In addition, it includes a database file containing processed results—but no raw data.

Instructions: Source the three function files and the 01_setupenv.R script. Then, run the code in the order of the prefixed numbers for each script in each subdirectory. 

Note: Running end-to-end is only possible if working with the raw database files, which are in the author's possession. The database file provided here, iaan.db, only contains result sets that power figures and tables (and thererfore can be used to reproduce figures and tables). To inquire about obtaining the raw database files, please reach out to the author.

Script Categories:
- 02-08_eda contain code for explatory analysis
- 09-13_fs contain code for feature and lag selection
- 12-13_ss contain code for summary statistics
- 13-17_twfe contain the primary two-way fixed effects regression modeling
- 18-20_es contains event study estimation
- 21_ml contains machine learning; namely, Bayesian Structural Time Series
- 22-24_rc contain some robustness checks
